unfortunately due to corrupted files i do not have much in the way of previous information.

from what i can remember i have changed almost the entire layout and design i had originally though of going with a blue and white theme however the owners wanted a more earthy autumn feel so thats what i did with the design itself as well as adding lots of images to brighten up the website.

home page :
before my files were corrupted i was originally gonna have image links as navigation however i found that to look too unprofessional so i decided to go with a standard navigation menu that was implemented using the nav command as well as i styled this menu to be interactive and have a tactile feel when hovered over i have also added a lot more information.

about us page : 
this page was pretty bare bones and now i have added some about us information such as the history of the business as well as the missin of the business these are two different categories and are seperated into a text box each there is also an image to break the information up.

events page :
this page has been completely revamped it now has an interactive calendar so that the owners can add and display dates this calendar also marks dates automatically and displays them there is also a function to add the name of the evenmt and clear all information once the event is over.

products page :
here i have added images of the products these images also contain a drop down arrow this drop down allows the user to view information on the product these resize to the screeen these are also place holder images for the mean time until i take some professional photos 

contact page :
this page was very basic in part 1 now i have split the information into three different boxes with owners information such as name as well as contact infor to be added in the future the second box displays location this will have an address as well as a map in the future and the last box displays an input text box for name email address and message this is so user can contact the business owners directly through the website.

css stylesheet : 
i have implemented an external stylesheet to style my website this is where all the coding for the design is done i created all the boxes as well as spacing and color through this stylesheet it is linked to every page 

logo implementation :
i have also included a logo on every page as this was done through the style sheet and the img code line on the stryle sheet i resized the image and had it be small in  the top left corner of every page.

responsivce design :
i have used the @ media code to create responsive desing to have a hamburger style menu when the website is in a smaller format
