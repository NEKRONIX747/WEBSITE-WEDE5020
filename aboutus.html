        <h2>History of Our Business</h2>
        <p>This business was created out of passion and love for the art we call baking. Our business was established in 2019 where it first started as Bakeables, a successful family-run bakery in Hayfields, Pietermaritzburg. Covid-19 caused us to temporarily close, but our passion remained, leading to the creation of The Littlest Homestead, working tirelessly from our kitchen to bring you the most delectable delights.</p>
