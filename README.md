as you can see i have clealry labelled and comented this was more for my benefit as i did not know what images to add right away so i could back to the exact lines of code to add in the images i know that we are only starting to cover javascript now but i wanted to get mostly finished so i added functions with java to make my life a little easier for the final poe

the next 2 screen shots are my products page code

<img width="1869" height="979" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-30 221039" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46b7da6e-a98e-4b2f-9587-4541f2ca01d6" />

this is the code behind my products page its basic yet i have made good use of divide as well as the class code i have also used img code as well as have a seperate folder for all my images all these images are place holders as i will be taking professional ones over the weekend 

these next 2 screenshots are of my contact page

<img width="1856" height="971" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-30 221108" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9452ace7-2c63-43da-a791-14369da76fda" />

here i have made use of more commentary to keep organised so i do not get confused with the code i am creating it helps when seperating code to stay organised

the next three screenshots are of my css style sheet

<img width="1864" height="970" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-30 221125" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8a625ca-73b7-4ac7-a0ce-a5ea7ef6eeb5" />

this is my style sheet i have utilised a lot of commentary in this as i needed to break up the different pages throughout the coding process this helped with remaining organised a lot of what i have done here is to style the website as well as the image boxes i use as containers for my images i also did a lot of font styling as well as colour styling and used containers to create decorations such as my logo and at the last screen shot this is where i implemented responsive design
