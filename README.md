as you can see i have clealry labelled and comented this was more for my benefit as i did not know what images to add right away so i could back to the exact lines of code to add in the images i know that we are only starting to cover javascript now but i wanted to get mostly finished so i added functions with java to make my life a little easier for the final poe

the next 2 screen shots are my products page code

<img width="1869" height="979" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-30 221039" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46b7da6e-a98e-4b2f-9587-4541f2ca01d6" />

this is the code behind my products page its basic yet i have made good use of divide as well as the class code i have also used img code as well as have a seperate folder for all my images all these images are place holders as i will be taking professional ones over the weekend 

these next 2 screenshots are of my contact page

<img width="1856" height="971" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-30 221108" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9452ace7-2c63-43da-a791-14369da76fda" />

here i have made use of more commentary to keep organised so i do not get confused with the code i am creating it helps when seperating code to stay organised

the next three screenshots are of my css style sheet

<img width="1864" height="970" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-30 221125" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8a625ca-73b7-4ac7-a0ce-a5ea7ef6eeb5" />

this is my style sheet i have utilised a lot of commentary in this as i needed to break up the different pages throughout the coding process this helped with remaining organised a lot of what i have done here is to style the website as well as the image boxes i use as containers for my images i also did a lot of font styling as well as colour styling and used containers to create decorations such as my logo and at the last screen shot this is where i implemented responsive design

FEEDBACK AND WHAT IVE CHANGED.

In part 2 I had no feedback due to achieving 100% for the website however I did loose marks for late submission which couldn’t be helped due to loosing all my data and having to start again on the day of the submission so I had noting to change per say however I did indeed add a whole bunch of things which will be fully described in my changelog on Github.

WHAT IVE ADDED 

I have added a lightbox gallery to my home page as well as changed the layout of my about us page as well as adding a dynamic search function to the products page and I have added a working dynamic map onto the contact us page I will provide screenshots below of what the pages look like I will also be doing a YouTube video on the functionality and design of my website as well as showing the code behind the website that link will be at the end of this document. the reason I will be doing this as my screenshot function is no longer working so therefore I will be showing the code in video format. Here are the screen shots of the websit.

 

This is my welcome message.

This is the bottom of the page and it has an image to make it look nice.

 <img width="1850" height="951" alt="Opera Snapshot_2025-11-03_231423_events html" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb6c4da-69bc-4188-806e-34b2a7d20bfb" />


This is the contact us page this is where my form and map are those will also be shown in the functionality of this document and youtube video.

 
<img width="1846" height="941" alt="Opera Snapshot_2025-11-03_231437_events html" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5deeec7-1955-4420-ad2d-b84ee17b3139" />

 <img width="1823" height="847" alt="Opera Snapshot_2025-11-03_231451_contactus html" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33668edf-a29f-4e10-8d7c-0e5fb9cfacc5" />

As for colour scheme I have stuck with my original design as stipulate by the owners to have earthy tones and autumn colours and combining the two with a professional approach to make the business website more attractive and easy to use for the average user.
<img width="1850" height="945" alt="Opera Snapshot_2025-11-03_231516_contactus html" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f48cdaf-ef58-4b3e-bc6c-2942ec48eb83" />

FUNCTIONALITY

 

Here we have a look at the dynamic search function as you can see when I start typing something that related keywords and letters will show the product that is being searched if you want to see it in action watch the youtube video as well as what happens when you don’t type anything related.
 

This is what happens when you pick a category and no related items are in that category as you can see the category system works as intended.
<img width="1817" height="834" alt="Opera Snapshot_2025-11-03_231539_products html" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6caa5d4a-f979-4ab3-b65a-0da5f215e4eb" />
